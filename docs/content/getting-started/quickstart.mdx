# Dagster Quickstart

Welcome to Dagster! In this guide, you'll get up-and-running with the [Dagster Quickstart](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-quickstart) project. This project demonstrates the power of Dagster, and provides a starting point to allow further exploration of Dagster's features.

---

## Introduction

You can run the [Dagster Quickstart](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-quickstart) project without installing anything locally by using the pre-configured [GitHub Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces)! For more information on how to use the quickstart project, see the [README](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-quickstart/blob/main/README.md) file in the project's repository.

## Navigate the UI & Materialize Assets

If you've followed the instructions in the README of **Dagster Quickstart** project, you should have a running instance of Dagster! From here, we can run our data pipeline.

In the UI, click **Materialize All** when viewing the lineage of assets. In Dagster, _materialization_ is the word we use to describe running the code associated with an asset and producing an output.

width={1000}

That's it! You now have two materialized Dagster assets:

width={2402}
height={1956}
/>

But wait - there's more. Because the `hackernews_top_stories` asset returned some `metadata`, you can view the metadata right in the UI:

1. Click the asset
2. In the sidebar, click the **Show Markdown** link in the **Materialization in Last Run** section. This opens a preview of the pipeline result, allowing you to view the top 10 HackerNews stories:

## The Code, Explained

```python file=/getting-started/quickstart/assets.py
import json
import requests

import pandas as pd

from dagster import (
    MaterializeResult,
    MetadataValue,
    asset,
)
from dagster_quickstart.configurations import HNStoriesConfig


@asset
def hackernews_top_story_ids(config: HNStoriesConfig):
    """Get top stories from the HackerNews top stories endpoint."""
    top_story_ids = requests.get("https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json").json()

    with open(config.hn_top_story_ids_path, "w") as f:
        json.dump(top_story_ids[: config.top_stories_limit], f)


@asset(deps=[hackernews_top_story_ids])
def hackernews_top_stories(config: HNStoriesConfig) -> MaterializeResult:
    """Get items based on story ids from the HackerNews items endpoint."""
    with open(config.hn_top_story_ids_path, "r") as f:
        hackernews_top_story_ids = json.load(f)

    results = []
    for item_id in hackernews_top_story_ids:
        item = requests.get(f"https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{item_id}.json").json()
        results.append(item)

    df = pd.DataFrame(results)
    df.to_csv(config.hn_top_stories_path)

    return MaterializeResult(
        metadata={
            "num_records": len(df),
            "preview": MetadataValue.md(str(df[["title", "by", "url"]].to_markdown())),
        }
    )
```

## Next steps

Congrats on running your first Dagster pipeline! This example used [assets](/tutorial), which most Dagster projects utilize because they let data engineers:

- Think in the same terms as stakeholders
- Answer questions about data quality and lineage
- Work with the modern data stack (dbt, Airbyte/Fivetran, Spark)
- Create declarative freshness policies instead of task-driven cron schedules

Dagster also offers [ops and jobs](/guides/dagster/intro-to-ops-jobs), but we recommend starting with assets.

If you would like to create a project of your own, you can:

- Scaffold a blank project. Check out the [new project guide](/getting-started/create-new-project) for more info.
- Start with an official example, such as the [dbt + Dagster project](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster). Check out [all the examples in GitHub](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/examples).
