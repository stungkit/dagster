# Using dbt with Dagster, part two: Load dbt models as Dagster assets

<Note>
  This is part two of the{" "}
  <a href="/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster">

  </a>{" "}
  tutorial.
</Note>

At this point, you should have a [fully-configured dbt project](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/set-up-dbt-project) that's ready to work with Dagster.

In this section, you'll finally begin integrating dbt with Dagster! To do this, you'll:

- [Create a Dagster project that wraps your dbt project](#step-1-create-a-dagster-project-that-wraps-your-dbt-project)
- [Inspect your Dagster project in Dagster's UI](#step-2-inspect-your-dagster-project-in-dagsters-ui)
- [Build your dbt models in Dagster](#step-3-build-your-dbt-models-in-dagster)
- [Understand the Python code in your Dagster project](#step-4-understand-the-python-code-in-your-dagster-project)

## Step 1: Create a Dagster project that wraps your dbt project

You can create a Dagster project that wraps your dbt project by using the `dagster-dbt` command line interface. Make sure you're in the directory where your `dbt_project.yml` is. If you're continuing from the previous section, then you'll already be in this directory. Then, run:

```shell
dagster-dbt project scaffold --project-name jaffle_dagster
```

This creates a directory called `jaffle_dagster/` inside the current directory. The `jaffle_dagster/` directory contains a set of files that define a Dagster project.

In general, it's up to you where to put your Dagster project. It's most common to put your Dagster project at the root of your git repository. Therefore, in this case, because the `dbt_project.yml` was at the root of the `jaffle_shop` git repository, we created our Dagster project there.

**Note**: The `dagster-dbt project scaffold` command creates the Dagster project in whatever directory you run it from. If that's a different directory from where your `dbt_project.yml` lives, then you'll need to provide a value for the `--dbt-project-dir` option so that Dagster knows where to look for your dbt project.

## Step 2: Inspect your Dagster project in Dagster's UI

Now that you have a Dagster project, you can run Dagster's UI to take a look at it.

1. Change directories to the Dagster project directory:

   ```shell
   cd jaffle_dagster/
   ```

2. To start Dagster's UI, run the following:

   ```shell
   dagster dev
   ```

   Which will result in output similar to:

   ```shell
   Serving dagster-webserver on http://127.0.0.1:3000 in process 70635
   ```

3. In your browser, navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:3000>. The page will display the assets:

  <!--

  -->

width={2688}
height={1680}
/>

## Step 3: Build your dbt models in Dagster

You can do more than view your dbt models in Dagster â€“ you can also run them. In Dagster, running a dbt model corresponds to _materializing_ an asset. Materializing an asset means running some computation to update its contents in persistent storage. In this tutorial, that persistent storage is our local DuckDB database.

To build your dbt project, i.e. materialize your assets, click the **Materialize all** button near the top right corner of the page. This will launch a run to materialize the assets. When finished, the **Materialized** and **Latest Run** attributes in the asset will be populated:

<!--
![Asset graph in Dagster's UI, showing materialized assets](/images/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/load-dbt-models/asset-graph-materialized.png)

src="/images/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/load-dbt-models/asset-graph-materialized.png"
width={2688}
height={1680}
/>

After the run completes, you can:

- Click the **asset** to open a sidebar containing info about the asset, including its last materialization stats and a link to view the [**Asset details** page](/concepts/webserver/ui#asset-details)
- Click the ID of the **Latest Run** in an asset to view the [**Run details**](/concepts/webserver/ui#run-details) page. This page contains detailed info about the run, including timing information, errors, and logs.

## Step 4: Understand the Python code in your Dagster project

You saw how you can create a Dagster project that loads a dbt project. How does this work? Understanding how Dagster loads a dbt project will give you a foundation for customizing how Dagster runs your dbt project, as well as for connecting it to other data assets outside of dbt.

The most important file is the Python file that contains the set of definitions for Dagster to load: `jaffle_shop/definitions.py`. Dagster executes the code in this file to find out what assets it should be aware of, as well as details about those assets. For example, when you ran `dagster dev` in the previous step, Dagster executed the code in this file to determine what assets to display in the UI.

In our `definitions.py` Python file, we import from `assets.py`, which contains the code to model our dbt models as Dagster assets. To return a Dagster asset for each dbt model, the code in this `assets.py` file needs to know what dbt models you have. It finds out what models you have by reading a file called a `manifest.json`, which is a file that dbt can generate for any dbt project and contains information about every model, seed, snapshot, test, etc. in the project.

To retrieve the `manifest.json`, `assets.py` imports from `artifacts.py`, which manages resolving the `manifest.json` file:

```python file=integrations/dbt/tutorial/load_dbt_models/artifacts.py startafter=start_load_manifest endbefore=end_load_manifest
import os
from pathlib import Path

from dagster_dbt import DbtArtifacts

# This class helps us manage expectations that
# * If using `dagster dev` (or set the environment variable DAGSTER_DBT_PARSE_PROJECT_ON_LOAD) compile the manifest on load.
# * If not expect the manifest.json to already be prepared. This can be done by running this file as a script.
dbt_artifacts = DbtArtifacts(
    project_dir=Path(__file__).joinpath("..", "..", "..").resolve()
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run this file as a script as part of deployment process to prepare manifest and handle package data
    dbt_artifacts.prepare()
```

As the comment explains, <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DbtArtifacts" /> helps us achieve a nice workflow regarding our `manifest.json` file. When using `dagster dev`, the `manifest.json` is compiled on load which ensures that we pick up any changes while developing. Outside of development, it is expected that `manifest.json` was already compiled as part of the deployment process. This avoids the time-consuming overhead of compiling the manifest in the Dagster processes that need to load the Definitions.

Once you've got a path to a `manifest.json`, it's time to define your Dagster assets using it. The following code, in your project's `assets.py`, does this:

```python file=integrations/dbt/tutorial/load_dbt_models/assets.py startafter=start_dbt_assets endbefore=end_dbt_assets
from dagster import AssetExecutionContext
from dagster_dbt import DbtCliResource, dbt_assets

from .artifacts import dbt_artifacts


@dbt_assets(manifest=dbt_artifacts.manifest_path)
def jaffle_shop_dbt_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    yield from dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream()
```

This code might look a bit fancy, because it uses a decorator. Here's a breakdown of what's going on:

- It creates a variable named `jaffle_shop_dbt_assets` that holds an object that represents a set of Dagster assets.
- These Dagster assets reflect the dbt models described in the manifest file. The manifest file is passed in using the `manifest` argument.
- The decorated function defines what should happen when you materialize one of these Dagster assets, e.g. by clicking the **Materialize** button in the UI or materializing it automatically by putting it on a schedule. In this case, it will invoke the `dbt build` command on the selected assets. The `context` parameter that's provided along with `dbt build` carries the selection.

If you later want to customize how your dbt models are translated into Dagster assets, you'll do so by editing its definition in `assets.py`.

## What's next?

At this point, you've loaded your dbt models into Dagster as assets, viewed them in Dagster's asset graph UI, and materialized them. Next, you'll learn how to [add upstream Dagster assets](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/upstream-assets).
